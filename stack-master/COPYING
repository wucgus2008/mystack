STACK is released under the MIT license.

http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

However, by default STACK links to the Boolector solver, which is
released under GPLv3.  In that case, STACK is under GPL as well.

If you want to keep the MIT license for STACK, use another solver.
See the INSTALL file for details.
