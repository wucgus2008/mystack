Building Problems
-----------------

* Cannot find llvm-config.

You need to build your own llvm, as instructed in the INSTALL file.


* "fatal error: llvm/Analysis/CFG.h: No such file or directory"

As detailed in the INSTALL file, you need the development version of llvm.
3.3 doesn't work.


* "cc1plus: error unrecognized command line option -std=c++11"

You need a decent C++ compiler that supports C++11.


Bug Reports
-----------

* A lot of false positives (null pointer dereference) from C++ delete.

Use the clang++ you build, as instructed in the INSTALL file, and
you shouldn't see such false positives.  STACK relies on information
from that custom built clang++ to recognize delete and avoid false
positives.


* "LLVM ERROR: Bad DataLayout ctor used."

This happens if clang fails to compile your source code.  Either
ignore such messages, or fix your code for clang.
